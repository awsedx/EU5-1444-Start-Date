The day after the crushing defeat of the Poles and Hungarians by the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Varna, and the death of King Władysław III of Poland, ending the Crusade of Varna.

Miss the nostalgic EU4 start? Want to get into the action of the Ages of Discovery and Refomation sooner? We do too!

This mod aims to bring the year 1444 to life, through a changed start date, map, and technological setup, with plans to extend this treatment to characters, pops, situations, and more, to fully immerse you in this new yet familiar scenario. 

[b][i]WIP: this mod is being actively worked on, and far from finished. As such, many details may still be inaccurate. For this, your help would be appreciated, in researching the time period to help create the most accurate depiction of 1444 we can.[/i][/b]
